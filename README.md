PhD Project: An anonymous authentication scheme with privacy-aware revocation in VANETs using Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge proofs

This repository contains the script code developed for my PhD project focused on enhancing the efficiency and privacy of certificate revocation mechanisms in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). The proposed scheme 
leverages zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain technology to ensure secure and scalable certificate revocation, while maintaining user privacy.

Features

  Bilinear Pairing Accumulator: Efficiently handles large-scale certificate revocations without linear growth in computation.
  
  Blockchain Integration: Utilizes a consortium blockchain to distribute and store revoked certificates, enhancing availability and security.
  
  Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Ensures privacy by enabling vehicles to prove their authorization without revealing sensitive information.
  
  Batch Witness Update: Allows vehicles to update their revocation status efficiently, even when not continuously connected to the network.

Repository Structure
