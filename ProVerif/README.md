I utilize the ProVerif tool to verify the security of my authentication protocols. ProVerif is a highly regarded automated analysis tool specifically designed to verify the security properties of cryptographic protocols. It ensures essential security properties such as secrecy, authentication, and anonymity. The tool supports many cryptographic primitives, including encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and hash functions, making it a robust choice for comprehensive security analysis. 

ProVerif is widely used to test the security requirements of a protocol and can handle input files encoded in several languages. The pi-calculus, considered state-of-the-art, underpins the modeling capabilities of ProVerif, allowing for rigorous and detailed security analysis. Additionally, the abstraction of non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs is formalized within the applied pi-calculus by Backes, further enhancing the tool's ability to analyze complex cryptographic protocols.
